## About The App

WizeTodoList is an application designed to efficiently manage users (Assignees) and tasks (Todos). Users can be added to the system via the Assignees page accessible from the sidebar. Simply click on the "Create Assignee" button and enter the user details.

Once users are created, you can navigate to the Todos page to select or create new tasks and assign them to the desired user.
